# EncryptDecrypt
Elliptic curve analogue ElGamal encryption scheme requires encoding of the plain message onto
elliptic curve coordinate using Koblitz encoding technique before encryption operation.
The paper proposes a medical image encryption scheme using improved ElGamal encryption technique.
A new Ô¨Ånding has been made in the proposed method where separate calculations for encoding plain message
to elliptic curve coordinate are removed. The algorithm in the improved version of ElGamal encryption scheme
is designed to encrypt medical image where data expansion issue is resolved and execution speed is enhanced. 
The strength of the proposed method is insured through various statistical and security analyses and comparison with other
existing encryption schemes.

An android application is made to encrypt and decrypt texts and numbers using the Elliptic curve analogue ElGamal encryption scheme. There are more applications of it as mentioned in paper and so the further works will also be done on image and audio encryption.
